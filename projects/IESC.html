        <p>The Intel® Edge Solutions Challenge (IESC) is an ongoing series of time-bound campaigns designed to support
             and award Intel® ecosystem partners as they develop and deploy optimized solutions based on Intel® 
             architecture and ingredients.</p>
        <p>Technical innovation is at the center of how societies build and manage cities, and new technology is 
            critical to advancing the way populations move, organize, and evolve.

        <h2 style="font-size: 2rem">Project: Traffic Light Controller System</h2>

        <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem">Problem Statement</h2>

        <p>In urban areas, traffic congestion at intersections is a significant issue that leads to increased travel
             times, higher vehicle emissions, and reduced overall efficiency of the transportation network. Traditional
              traffic light control systems are often static and unable to adapt to varying traffic patterns throughout
               the day. This results in inefficient use of road capacity, with some traffic lights remaining green for 
               too long when there is little traffic, or red for too long during peak hours, causing unnecessary delays
                and traffic buildup. Moreover, the lack of real-time data analysis and adaptive response mechanisms 
                exacerbates traffic management challenges, particularly in densely populated cities where traffic patterns
                 are complex and dynamic.</p>

        <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem">Our Solution</h2>

        <p>To address the challenges posed by outdated traffic light control systems, we propose the development of an 
            AI-Driven Traffic Light Controller System. This system will employ a combination of edge computing and artificial
             intelligence to dynamically manage traffic flow at intersections based on real-time data</p>
        
        <li><strong>Real-time Traffic Data Collection:</strong> Install a network of high-resolution cameras at each intersection to capture 
            and analyze traffic data, including vehicle count and queue lengths during red light phases.</li>
        <li><strong>Intelligent Traffic Light Control Algorithm:</strong> Develop an AI model that processes the collected data to predict traffic
             patterns and dynamically adjust traffic light timings. The model will be designed to optimize traffic flow by minimizing
              wait times and maximizing the use of road capacity</li>
        <li><strong>Edge Computing Infrastructure:</strong> Utilize edge computing to process data locally at the intersection, enabling immediate
             decision-making without relying on cloud connectivity. This ensures that traffic light adjustments are made in real-time
              and are not affected by network latency.</li>
        <li><strong>Customizable and Adaptive AI Models:</strong> Train AI models to adapt to specific traffic conditions and intersection geometries. 
            These models will be capable of learning from traffic patterns and continuously improving their predictions and control strategies.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Privacy and Security:</strong> Implement robust data privacy measures to ensure that no personal data is collected or stored during 
            the traffic monitoring process, and that all data transmission is secure.</li>


        <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem">Expected Benefits of the Solution</h2>
        <li><strong>Reduced Congestion:</strong> By dynamically adjusting traffic light timings, the system will reduce traffic congestion, leading to shorter
             travel times and a more efficient use of road networks.</li>
        <li><strong>Lower Emissions:</strong> Decreased idling times for vehicles will result in lower emissions, contributing to improved air quality and 
            environmental sustainability.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced Safety:</strong> Optimized traffic flow can reduce the likelihood of accidents, improving overall road safety.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalable and Maintainable:</strong> The system will be designed for easy scalability to additional intersections and will include a maintenance
             plan for ongoing performance optimization and hardware/software upgrades.</li>
